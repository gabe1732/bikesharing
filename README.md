## Overview of bike sharing analysis  
The purpose of this week's analysis was to help determine the feasablity of starting a new bike sharing business in Des Moines.  We analiyzed information from an already established market in New York.  Although the markets are totally different we are hoping we can identify trends that could relate to Des Moines.

## Summary 
In conclusion it looks like a Surf shop that sells ice cream to supplement their revenue seems like a good long term investment.  In looking at the data even if the tempatures were to drop dramtically they should be able to quickly change products and sale hot choclate in the cold months if that were to happen.  One data point that I wished was added was water temp and wave data.  To see if people would be surfing in that area as well.
