## Overview of bike sharing analysis  
The purpose of this week's analysis was to help determine the feasablity of starting a new bike sharing business in Des Moines.  We analiyzed information from an already established market in New York.  Although the markets are totally different we are hoping we can identify trends that could relate to Des Moines.    
 

## Results

  ### Ride duration
With most of the rides lasting less than 20 mins the bike sharing would be helpful for those short quick trips to the store or friends house.  Short trips also mean that the bike sharing would me feasable for most physical ftness levels.

### Definte high usage spots
They're definite high usage spots which means you will not have to worry about not being able to get back after finishing your task since there will most likely be a bike nearby in high traffic areas

### Stat and stop heat map
Bike usage patterns follow tradtional work day schedules.  With most of the bikes being rent during workdays at 8am and 5pm.  This could save the common work parking fees.  while also giving the users the freedom to come and go as they please since they would not have wait for the public trasportation schedule.

Perhaps the most important number of them all. over 2 million rides in the month of august.  Even if our average revenue amount per ride is just 50 cents that is over a million dollars in revenue for one month.  

## Summary 
In conclusion, I think there needs to be more informaiton looked at like average revenue per ride and average expense per ride.  It will be a successful venture if you have the volume of userr going to work on bikes and spending lesiure time on the weekends in the same area that they also work.
